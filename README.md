## ðŸš€ Deploying to Railway (Flask/Python)

1. Ensure your `requirements.txt` is up to date and includes `gunicorn` and `flask`.
2. Your `Procfile` should contain:
   ```
   web: gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:$PORT app.app:app
   ```
   (Adjust `app.app:app` if your Flask app is elsewhere.)
3. Push your code to GitHub.
4. On Railway:
   - Create a new project and link your GitHub repo.
   - Railway will auto-detect Python and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
   - It will use your `Procfile` to start the app.
5. Set any required environment variables in the Railway dashboard.
6. Visit your Railway app URL to verify deployment.
